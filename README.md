# SDES


This program aims to simulate an S-DES chip using C++.
	
The program prompts the user for choice of encrypt or decrypt. 

It will next prompt for the appropriate 8-bit input (plaintext or ciphertext dependent on encrypt or decrypt). 

After obtaining a legitamate plaintext or ciphertext, it will prompt for the 10-bit key. 

The output will be an 8-bit ciphertext (encrypt) or plaintext (decrypt). It will ALSO output Key1 and Key2.
